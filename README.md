# Pt-Merc Userscript
For help with userscript contact [ThtAstronautGuy](https://www.torn.com/profiles.php?XID=1977683) on Torn.
# Terms of use
This script is provided without warranty or guarentee, etc etc.
Your API key is only stored locally, and WILL NOT be sent to us. By using this script you agree that your battle stats will be sent to our merc team so that they will know if they can hit you or not. Hosps are done on best effort only, and if there is no one on to hit you, you will not be hit.
# How to use
Hitting the update key button will allow you to set your key. This will validate that your key is valid, and should clear the saved key if you enter an incorrect one. 
If you hit "Hosp Me" and your key is not set, it will prompt you to add your key, then you will most likely have to hit the "Hosp Me" button again.
Premium hosps can only be done with advance notice, as the weapon must be loaned out to the member from the PT-Family armoury, as such that button will link to our thread, where you can see the online status of all members of the merc team.
